The goal of responseFunctions is to provide a set of useful non-linear response functions with both R source-code and Stan source-code.

## Installation

You can install the development version of responseFunctions from [GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("PRIMER-e/responseFunctions")
```

## Example

This is a basic example which shows you how to solve a common problem:

```{r example}
library(responseFunctions)

modskurt(x = 500,
         H = 1000,
         m = 750,
         s = 20,
         r = 0.75,
         d = 50,
         p = 1)
```
